# Text-to-pointcloud cross-modal localization research

# Datasets

# Method

# Experiments

# TODOS
- Use only state-dict
- Acc last in model name
- Shorted use_features in plot/model name
- No "negative:yes/no", only positive or "show_true negative"
- Direction names
- Merge datasets necessary / possible? Only 1 dataset with get_sub_dataset()
- Orientations

# Wishlist for next project
- Tests: At least unit and sanity checs for model training
- Logging?
- Use global args file(s), load there once, always use from there instead of passing
- Formatter
- Often EasyDict or Class: for Dataset&Loader, ??
- Think about and implement evaluation early!
